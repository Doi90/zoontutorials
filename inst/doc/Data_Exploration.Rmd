# Introduction

When we undertake a Species Distribution Model (SDM) we use both species occurrence data collected from field surveys or collated observations as well as environmental predictor data. Before beginning to use covariate data to model occurrence over space, a crucial first step is to familiarise ourselves with the data and its limitations. It is important to do this before modelling the data, as data exploration can result in consequences for the choice of model applied as well as the accurracy of the inference taken from the model. Equally, choice of model a priori may bring a unique set of assumptions that we need to check for in our data. This guide outlines a few suggested steps implemented in both base R as well as using `zoon` `output` and `process` modules for data exploration (Figure 1).

```{r echo = F, out.width= '400px', fig.align = "center", fig.cap="*Figure 1. Conceptual flowchart for data exploration*"}
knitr::include_graphics("../vignettes/Images/DataExp_ConceptualDiagram.png")
```

We will start by setting up a basic `zoon` `workflow()` with the Carolina wren presence-only data and raster covariate datasets for illustration.  We will set `process = Background(1000)`, `model = NullModel`, and `output = PrintOccurrenceMap` - this map simply shows us our raw occurrence points (in red) and our background points (in black), no model has been applied. 

```{r packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(zoon)
```

```{r workflow, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Carolina_Wren_Workflow <- workflow(occurrence = CarolinaWrenPO,
                                   covariate = CarolinaWrenRasters,
                                   process = Background(1000),
                                   model = NullModel,
                                   output = PrintOccurrenceMap)
```

# Outliers/data cleaning

Species distribution datasets are, to varying degrees, reliant on observation records gathered by humans and therefore subject to human error. Even in situations where we are fitting a model to entirely remotely-sensed data such as bioclimatic variables, our species occurrence records are usually pen-and-paper recordings from the field. This manual data entry can lead to mistakes. Inaccurate data can lead us to draw false conclusions, and for conservation work this could mean squandering our limited resources for a species in locations where the species is not likely to occur. One way to check for nonsense entries is to the plot occurrence data to covariate one by one, allowing you to isolate unusual entries. For example, if you plotted against latitude, you might see a single occurrence value at a latitude outside the range of your study. 

You can visualise these plots using the `Relationships` output module. 

**insert here make it like hist freq of colours. ....**

```{r relationships workflow, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Carolina_Wren_Workflow <- workflow(occurrence = CarolinaWrenPO,
#                                   covariate = CarolinaWrenRasters,
#                                   process = Background(1000),
#                                   model = NullModel,
#                                   output = Relationships)
```

Environmental covariate data is also subject to error. For example, maybe the maximum value in your elevation variable is 1000 m, but you know that the highest peak in your study region is only 500 m. During the data entry process someone may have added an extra 0 to a 100 m measurement by mistake. Maybe your vegetation classification is showing as having ten levels despite it being an eight-category scale. Chances are a spelling mistake as benign as 'forest' instead of 'Forest' is the culprit. 

NA values are to be expected in our raster data (unless they are oblong in shape) as they are commonly masked to cover only a particular region (e.g. the border of a country or a national park) but are stored as a matrix and thus padded with NA values in cells of no interest, but we would not expect NA values in our training data. Finding NA values for covariates in the training data could also indicate that some data points have incorrect latitude/longitude values and are being mapped to locations outide the extent of our study, or that the data point sits on the border of the study region and "misses" the raster due to its resolution (i.e. a diagonal line is instead a series of alternating horizontal and vertical lines) and should be adjusted slightly.

You can check out your covariate data using some base R functions as below: 

```{r}
# summary(occ.cov.df$pcGr)
# max(occ.cov.df$pcGr)
# min(occ.cov.df$pcGr)
```

# Collinearity

Collinearity is the existence of correlations among covariates. When two covariates in a model are correlated, for example perhaps altitude and temperature, then the modelling method will struggle to identify the impact of each variable independently and the significance of either may be masked. If covariate A and covariate B are correlated, for example, one approach would be to include one in the model, preferably based on sound biological justification. Should variable A be included, then in the discussion of the results it will be important to note that the observed effect could equally be driven by correlated covariate B. 

You can check for collinearity in many ways, but the simplest is to look at a pair plot of your covariate data. You can do this in the `zoon` output module `PairPlot`. Variable names are listed down the diagonal, the bottom half of the panel shows the pairs plots, and the top half shows $r^2$ values for the relationships.

**Saras to make it so pairplot does not have overlapping points - hexbin?**

```{r pairplot workflow, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Carolina_Wren_Workflow <- workflow(occurrence = CarolinaWrenPO,
                                   covariate = CarolinaWrenRasters,
                                   process = Background(1000),
                                   model = NullModel,
                                   output = PairPlot)
```

A tidy summary of many of the following data exploration methods is provided with the `GenerateCovariateReport` `Output` module. This is based on the `GenerateReport()` function in the `DataExplorer` `R` package, but tailored specifically for SDM analyses.

This module generates a data profiling report for our training data (the data set that our model is fit to) and/or our raster data (that our model uses to predict the distribution of our study species). These reports will show our data's structure, the percentage of missing data, the distribution of our covariates (histograms for continuous data, bar charts for discrete), and show the results of a correlation analysis. We need to tell the module which report(s) to generate by setting the `type` argument to one of "D" (Data Report only), "R" (Raster report only), or "DR" (Data and Raster Report).

```{r DataReport, eval=FALSE}
output = GenerateCovariateReport(type = "DR")
```

# Accessor function method
It is helpful to have a basic workflow loaded before we begin so that we can take advantage of zoon's accessor functions. We can call the accessor function `Process()` to generate a data frame object with extracted raster covariate values for each occurrence point. We can examine the first six rows of this data frame by using the base R function `head()`. 

``` {r}
# occ.cov.df <- Process(Carolina_Wren_Workflow)$df
# head(occ.cov.df)
```

It is also useful to check the format of the covariates included to ensure continuous variables are stored as numeric data and categorical variables as factors so that they perform as expected in the model. Categorical variables may, for example, be erroneously listed in a numerical index (e.g. vegetation categories identified as 1-10 instead of 'VegClass1', 'VegClass2', etc) and therefore interpreted as numerical data. Similarly, if there are any typos in numerical data entries that introduce characters (e.g. '2 cm' instead of '2'), then a continuous variable will be classed as a factor. We can check the format of the data with the `str()` function, or check individual variables with `class()`. 

``` {r}
# str(occ.cov.df)
# class(occ.cov.df$pcMix)
```
